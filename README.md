# Best-Valorant-Agent-Picks



## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing statistics and performance data from Valorant, a popular first-person shooter (FPS) game developed by Riot Games.

## Data Collection
- The statistics and performance data were collected using an in-game tracking system (Valorant Tracker).
- The data includes information about players' Kill-Death-Assist (KDA) ratios, win rates, pick rates, average scores, and individual performance in terms of kills, deaths, and assists.

## Analysis
### Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA)
- A MANOVA test was performed to examine the relationship between KDA, win rate, pick rate, average score, kills, deaths, assists, and player names and maps.
- The null hypothesis was that there is no difference between player groups on the same map. The alternative hypothesis was that there is a significant difference.
- The results of the MANOVA test were analyzed using Tukey's method for pairwise comparisons.

### Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
- ANOVA tests were conducted to analyze the impact of individual player names on KDA, win rate, pick rate, average score, kills, deaths, and assists.
- The null hypothesis was that there is no significant difference between player performances.
- The ANOVA tests were performed for each performance metric individually.

### Tukey's Test
- Tukey's test was performed to compare the assist performance between different agents and maps.
- The test was conducted to determine if there were any significant differences in assist performance between agent-player combinations on the same map.
- The results were analyzed to identify agent-player combinations that exhibited significant differences.

### Agent Rankings
- Rankings were generated based on the results of the statistical tests.
- Agents were ranked based on the number of wins and losses compared to other agents.
- The rankings provide an insight into the performance of different agents in the game.

## Conclusion
- The analysis of the Valorant game statistics provides valuable insights into the performance and impact of different agents and maps on player performance.
- The rankings can help players make informed decisions about agent selection and strategy development.
